# Project Rules — Claude Code Must Follow These Always

## Pre-flight checklist (run through this before writing ANY code)

1. Does a similar util/hook/component already exist in the codebase? Search first.
2. Will this file exceed 500 lines? If yes, plan the split before starting.
3. Is this a server or client component? Default to server. Add `"use client"` only when needed.
4. Does this belong in `features/`, `components/`, `lib/`, or `services/`? Place it correctly.
5. Will this require a new npm package? Ask the user before installing anything new.

## Hard rules — never violate these

### File size

- **Never create a file longer than 500 lines.** If approaching the limit, split into smaller modules before continuing.
- One component per file. No exceptions.

### Functions

- **Max 3 parameters per function.** Beyond 3, use an options object: `function foo({ a, b, c, d }: FooOptions)`
- **Max 40 lines per function body.** Extract helpers if needed.
- Always declare explicit return types on functions.

### TypeScript

- **Never use `any`.** Use `unknown` and narrow it, or define a proper type.
- Always define prop interfaces above the component in the same file.
- Use `type` for unions/primitives, `interface` for object shapes.

### Imports & exports

- **No default exports** — except in `app/` page and layout files (Next.js requires it).
- Named exports everywhere else.
- Import order: builtin → external → internal (`@/`) → relative (`./`)

### Forbidden patterns

- **Never `fetch()` directly inside a component.** All data fetching goes through `src/services/`.
- **Never use `console.log`.** Use the pino logger from `src/lib/logger.ts`.
- **Never prop-drill more than 2 levels.** Use Context or Zustand instead.
- **Never hardcode secrets or API URLs.** Use env vars validated by `src/env.ts`.
- No `// @ts-ignore` or `// @ts-nocheck` comments.
- No `!` non-null assertions unless you add a comment explaining why it's safe.

## Folder structure — always follow this

This project uses a root-level layout (no `src/` directory). All paths below are relative to the repo root, and `@/` in imports resolves to the repo root.

```
app/                      # Next.js App Router pages, layouts, route handlers
components/               # Shared UI components (no business logic)
└── ui/                   # Primitive UI elements (shadcn-generated)
features/                 # Feature modules — self-contained
└── [feature-name]/
    ├── components/       # Components used only by this feature
    ├── hooks/            # Hooks used only by this feature
    ├── types.ts          # Types + Zod schemas for this feature
    └── index.ts          # Public API — only export what other features need
hooks/                    # Shared hooks used across multiple features
lib/                      # Shared utilities (logger, prisma, auth, env...)
├── env.ts                # Type-safe env vars (t3-oss/env-nextjs)
├── auth.ts               # Better Auth server config
├── auth-client.ts        # Better Auth React client
├── prisma.ts             # Prisma singleton
├── logger.ts             # Pino logger
├── query-client.ts       # TanStack Query client factory
└── validators/           # Zod schemas shared across features
services/                 # All external API / data-access calls — typed
stores/                   # Zustand stores
prisma/                   # Prisma schema and migrations
middleware.ts             # Next.js edge middleware (auth gating)
```

- Features cannot import from other features. Only from `shared/`, `lib/`, `components/`.
- If two features need the same thing, it moves to `lib/` or `components/`.

## Naming conventions

| Thing            | Convention                        | Example                          |
| ---------------- | --------------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| React components | PascalCase                        | `UserCard.tsx`                   |
| Hooks            | camelCase, `use` prefix           | `useUserData.ts`                 |
| Utils/helpers    | camelCase                         | `formatDate.ts`                  |
| Types/interfaces | PascalCase                        | `UserCardProps`, `ApiResponse`   |
| Zustand stores   | camelCase, `use` prefix + `Store` | `useAuthStore.ts`                |
| Server actions   | camelCase, verb first             | `createUser.ts`, `deletePost.ts` |
| Constants        | SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE              | `MAX_FILE_SIZE`                  |

## State management rules

- Local UI state → `useState`
- Shared client state → Zustand (in `stores/`)
- Server state / async → TanStack Query
- Forms → React Hook Form + Zod resolver
- Never mix Zustand and React Query for the same data

---

## Validation rules

- **All external data must be validated with Zod** — API responses, form inputs, env vars, URL params
- Define Zod schemas in the same file as the type, or in `[feature]/types.ts`
- Infer TypeScript types from Zod schemas: `type User = z.infer<typeof UserSchema>`

---

## After every code change

1. Run `pnpm lint` and fix ALL errors before saying the task is done.
2. Run `pnpm type-check` (`tsc --noEmit`) and fix all type errors.
3. If you modified a component, check that its props interface is still accurate.
4. If you created a new file, confirm it's in the right folder per the structure above.

---

## Server vs client components

- **Default: server component.** No `"use client"` directive.
- Add `"use client"` only when the component uses: `useState`, `useEffect`, browser APIs, event handlers, or third-party client-only libs.
- Never fetch data in a client component — use server components or React Query.
- Keep `"use client"` components as leaf nodes — push them down the tree as far as possible.

---

## What NOT to do (common AI mistakes to avoid)

- Don't create a new `utils.ts` at the root — check if `lib/` already has what you need
- Don't install new packages without asking — we have a curated dep list
- Don't create barrel files (`index.ts`) everywhere — only one per feature's public API
- Don't add `useEffect` for data that can be fetched server-side
- Don't create a new Context when Zustand already handles that state
- Don't write inline styles — use Tailwind classes
- Don't generate placeholder/TODO code and leave it — finish what you start
