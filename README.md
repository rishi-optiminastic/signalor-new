# Signalor Web

**The web app for [signalor.ai](https://signalor.ai) — an AI visibility / GEO (Generative Engine Optimization) platform.**

Track and improve how AI engines — ChatGPT, Gemini, Perplexity, Claude and Google AI Overviews — see, cite and describe your brand.

## What this is

This repository is the **Next.js front end** of Signalor: the marketing site, the free tools, and the customer dashboard where brands see their GEO score, tracked prompts, competitors, recommendations and fixes.

**Please read this before you start:** the **analyzer backend is a separate, proprietary service and is not included here.** This repo is its client. That means:

- You **can** run the entire UI locally, click through every screen, and develop against it — using the built-in stub mode. **No database, no backend, no API keys.**
- You **cannot** produce real GEO scores from this repo alone, because the crawling/scoring/LLM pipeline lives in the closed backend.

We would rather say that plainly up front than have you discover it after an hour of setup.

---

## Quick start (stub mode — nothing to set up but dependencies)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Optiminastic/signalor-web.git
cd signalor-web
pnpm install

cp .env.example .env.local
# then set these two in .env.local:
#   NEXT_PUBLIC_USE_STUBS=true
#   SKIP_ENV_VALIDATION=1

pnpm dev
```

Open <http://localhost:3000>. Onboarding and analysis return mocked data, so the full UI is clickable with no infrastructure.

> Requires **Node 20+** and **pnpm**. This project uses pnpm — npm/yarn installs are not supported.

### Running with real data

You need Postgres (for auth) and a reachable Signalor backend:

1. Set `DATABASE_URL`, `BETTER_AUTH_SECRET` (`openssl rand -base64 32`), `BETTER_AUTH_URL` and `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL` in `.env.local`.
2. Point `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL` at a Signalor backend.
3. Set `NEXT_PUBLIC_USE_STUBS=false` and remove `SKIP_ENV_VALIDATION`.

Every variable is documented in [`.env.example`](./.env.example). Nothing else is required — Google OAuth, email, Sanity, analytics and billing are all optional and degrade gracefully when unset.

> Dev must run on **Turbopack** (the default). `next dev --webpack` breaks `NEXT_PUBLIC_*` inlining.
