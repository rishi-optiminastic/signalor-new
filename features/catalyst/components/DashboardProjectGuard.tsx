 *  - A project exists but has never launched an analysis (abandoned the wizard
 *    after the URL step, which is what creates the org). Without this, that user
 *    lands on a permanently empty dashboard. Re-entering onboarding is safe: the
 *    backend dedupes the org on a 409, so no duplicate brand is created.

 * A pending or failed run still counts as launched — the dashboard shows their
 * progress. Only redirects on a *confirmed* empty fetch, so a transient backend
 * error never bounces a real user out.
