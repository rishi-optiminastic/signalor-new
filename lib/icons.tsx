/**
 * App-wide icon set. Filled Tabler icons aliased under their former lucide names
 * so they're drop-in everywhere a `LucideIcon` was used; genuinely functional
 * icons with no filled form (spinners, chevrons, arrows, close, grip, …) stay
 * lucide. Cast to `LucideIcon` so typed `icon: LucideIcon` fields keep working.
 *
 * Every app file imports icons from here (not 'lucide-react'). To make an icon
 * filled, move it from the lucide passthrough block to a `f(IconXxxFilled)` line.
